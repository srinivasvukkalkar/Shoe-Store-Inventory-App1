# The Shoe Store

This project is a simple shoe store application with five primary screens:

1. Login screen: Contains fields for email and password, with "Create" and "Login" buttons.
2. Welcome Screen: A welcome screen for onboarding.
3. Instructions Screen: Provides user instructions.
4. Shoe Listing Screen: Displays a list of shoes.
5. Shoe Detail Screen: A form to add details for a new shoe.

The navigation flow is as follows:

* After clicking the Login button on the Login screen, users are taken to the Welcome screen.
* From the Welcome screen, users can proceed to the Instructions screen.
* The Instructions screen has navigation to the Shoe Listing screen, which displays a list of default shoe items.
* In the Shoe Listing screen, users can click the Floating Action Button to navigate to the Shoe Detail screen, where they can input details for a new shoe.
* After entering the details and clicking Save, the app returns to the Shoe Listing screen, displaying the newly added shoe in the list.

This app demonstrates key Android concepts including navigation components, data binding, ViewModel, and LiveData to manage UI and data flow efficiently.
